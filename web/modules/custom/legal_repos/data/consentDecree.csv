XVIII. Attorneys� Fees, Costs, and Expenses 
A. Basis for Award of Fees, Costs and Expenses
1. The parties have agreed that it is appropriate as part of the settlement underlying this Consent Decree for Abercrombie to pay to Class Counsel, on behalf of the Class Representatives and the Settlement Class, reasonable attorneys' fees, litigation expenses, and costs in this case.
2. The Company has agreed to pay Class Counsel an award of reasonable attorneys' fees, litigation expenses, and costs in the amount of $7,250,000.00 for work performed and costs and expenses incurred through and including the Approval Date.  Included in this amount is approximately $540,000.00 for litigation costs and expenses incurred by Class Counsel.  This amount fully satisfies any arguable obligation the Company may have to pay attorneys' fees, litigation expenses, and costs for and on behalf of the Plaintiffs, Class Representatives and the Settlement Class for any and all work performed and costs and expenses incurred through and including the Approval Date.
3. The Company also has agreed to pay Class Counsel an amount of reasonable attorneys' fees, litigation expenses, and costs for work required to be performed by Class Counsel after the Approval Date pursuant to this Decree.  The Company agrees that Class Counsel shall be paid such attorneys' fees, expenses and costs in the amount of $600,000.00 for work performed and costs and expenses incurred after the Approval Date relating to defense of the Decree, monitoring, administration and implementation, including, without limitation, evaluating possible compliance with this Decree, including the retention of experts to assist in such evaluation, and defense of the Decree.  Except as provided in Section X.B.9 for appeals of decisions of the Special Master, this amount satisfies any arguable obligation the Company may have to pay attorneys' fees, expenses and costs to Class Counsel for any and all work performed and costs and expenses incurred after the Approval Date of the Decree for the monitoring, administration, implementation and defense of the Decree.
4. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to preclude Abercrombie from seeking attorneys' fees, expenses and costs incurred in litigating enforcement matters according to Title VII law applicable to a prevailing defendant under Section X.B.9. for appeals of decisions of the Special Master.
B. Payment of Award
1. Within fourteen (14) days following the Approval Date, Abercrombie shall pay to Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann & Bernstein, LLP one half (1/2) of the $7,250,000.00 or $3,625,000.00, for litigation-related attorneys' fees, expenses and costs as set forth in Section XVlII.A.2.  Abercrombie shall pay Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann & Bernstein, LLP the remaining amount within fourteen (14) days following the Final Approval Date.  Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann & Bernstein, LLP shall have sole responsibility to distribute attorneys' fees, expenses and costs to other Class Counsel, and if Abercrombie makes such payments to Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann & Bernstein, LLP, no Class Counsel may assert any claim for such payments from Abercrombie.  In the event that Final Approval of the Decree is not attained, Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann & Bernstein, LLP shall return to Abercrombie the initial payment of $3,625,000.00 within fifteen (15) days after the non-approval of the Decree becomes final.
2. The attorneys' fees, expenses and costs awarded and agreed to be paid by the Company pursuant to Section XVIII.A.3. shall be paid to Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann & Bernstein, LLP according to the following schedule:

March 15, 2010                                           $ 50,000

D. Any fees and expenses payable to Class Counsel shall be within the sole discretion of the Court. The validity of the Consent Decree is not contingent on any ruling regarding the payment of attorneys' fees and expenses. (Page, 57)

A. Albertson's shall pay Class Counsel $4.5 million in settlement of all fees and costs incurred in connection with this case.  Except as provided in paragraphs B and C, below, this amount shall include all work performed and costs incurred in the following: prosecuting the action from its inception through settlement; in obtaining preliminary and final approval of the Consent Decree from the District Court and any appeals therefrom; in distribution of the Class Fund; and in monitoring the Consent Decree throughout its term, except as set forth in paragraph B, below.
B. Nothing herein shall limit Albertson's obligation to pay Class Counsel's fees and costs incurred in connection with proceedings established under the terms of Article X of the Consent Decree.
C. Nothing herein shall limit Albertson's obligation to pay Class Counsel's fees and costs, at the firm's then current hourly rates without any multiplier or interest, for work performed in connection with (1) any appeal of the District Court's final approval to the extent such work exceeds 50 attorney hours and (2) the distribution of the Class Fund to the extent such work exceeds 50 attorney hours and 100 legal assistant hours, subject to Court approval regarding the reasonableness of any such additional fees.
D. If the time period for filing an appeal from the District Court's Final Approval Order expires and no timely appeal has been taken, Albertson's shall pay in full all attorneys' fees and costs, as set forth in Section II.A. above, to Class Counsel within seven (7) days.
E. In the event of an appeal from the Final Order approving the Decree, Albertson's shall, within seven (7) days of the filing of Notice of Appeal, pay 50% (i.e., $2.25 million) of the attorneys' fees and costs described in Section II.A., above, to Class Counsel and shall deposit the remaining 50% ($2.25 million) in an escrow account to be established jointly by Albertson's and by Class Counsel at the Bank of California in Oakland, California.  The escrow instructions for such account shall require the joint approval of the parties before any proceeds of such account shall be distributed either to Class Counsel or to Albertson's under the circumstances set forth below.  Class Counsel only shall have the right to direct investments from the escrow account.  The Bank of California shall be responsible solely to Class Counsel as to investment instructions.  The risk of loss on the principal shall be borne by Class Counsel.
In the event that the Final Approval Order of the District Court has been affirmed and no further appeals are permitted, Albertson's shall, within seven (7) days, direct the escrow agent to release all funds in such account to Class Counsel.  In the event that the Final Approval Order is reversed on appeal or is modified such that Albertson's exercises its right to declare the Decree null and void, Class Counsel shall direct that the escrow agent shall return to Albertson's the principal amount of $2.25 million, with interest at the one year Treasury Bill Rate [nearest equivalent to 365 days to maturity] as published in the Wall Street Journal on the day such funds are deposited in the escrow account; any remaining funds shall be released to Class Counsel.  If there are insufficient funds in the escrow account at such time to reimburse Albertson's in the amount described above, then Class Counsel shall pay any such deficiency to Albertson's at the time the funds are released from the bank.  In addition, in the event that the Final Approval Order is reversed on appeal, or is modified such that Albertson's exercises its right to declare the Decree null and void, Class Counsel shall return the $2.25 million in attorneys' fees initially paid to Class Counsel by Albertson's, with interest from the date Class Counsel received payment at the above-described Treasury Bill Rate within sixty (60) days of such event, together with any fees paid by Albertson's to Class Counsel in connection with such appeal.

Lucky Stores shall pay any such award in full within fifteen days of the award unless either there has been an appeal from the entry of judgment, or Lucky Stores files an appeal of the attorney�s fees and costs award.  In either event, within fifteen days of the award of attorneys� fees and costs, Lucky Stores shall pay plaintiff�s and plaintiff-intervenor�s counsel 75% of any said award, and deposit the balance in a jointly-controlled interest-bearing account jointly selected by the parties.  The full sum shall be given to counsel upon affirmation of the award/judgment.  If the award is reduced, the amount of such reduction with interest shall be returned to Lucky Stores and any remaining deposit shall be paid to plaintiffs� attorneys.  If the award is affirmed, the balance with interest will be paid to plaintiffs� attorneys.

a. Safeway agrees to pay Class Counsel attorney's fees and costs in the total sum of Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000.00), encompassing all work which has been or will be performed through the Fairness Hearing before the District Court and all work monitoring this Decree throughout its term, except this shall not include time reasonably spent responding to inquiries from Class Members following the Notice of Settlement.

If any appeal or collateral attack is filed within 185 days of the Effective Date, then one-half of the sum shall be paid on or about 186 days after the Effective Date.  The remaining half shall be placed in an interest-bearing account designated by Class Counsel (�Attorney's Fees Fund�).  The Attorney's Fees Fund, including all accrued interest, shall be delivered to Class Counsel upon final resolution of all appeals and collateral attacks upholding the Consent Decree.  In the event that the Consent Decree is set aside on any appeal or collateral attack, Saperstein, Mayecla & Goldstein, and any successor firms, guarantees that it will restore to Safeway the full amount of all attorney's fees delivered to it and, with regard to the Attorney's Fees Fund, it will restore that Fund, if needed, to the full amount of the principal deposited plus the amount of interest which would have been earned had the Attorney's Fees Fund earned the same rate of return as the Settlement Fund.
b. Class Counsel shall be paid reasonable attorney's fees and costs for work performed distributing the Settlement Sum set forth in paragraphs 55-56, resolving all disputes relevant to that distribution, responding to inquiries from Class Members following the Notice of Settlement and defending against any appeal or collateral attack.  These attorney's fees shall be based on Class Counsel's then-current customary hourly rates, with no Multiplier, premium or interest added.  Payment shall be made within 30 days of billing.
c. If Class Counsel prevails in any enforcement proceeding undertaken during the term of this Decree, Class Counsel shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs for work performed in connection with that proceeding.

Whether and to what extent Plaintiffs are a prevailing party in any proceeding to enforce the terms of this Decree shall be determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Special Master (or, if this matter is brought before the Court, in the sole and absolute discretion of the Judge). The Special Master or the Judge may, in his or her sole discretion, award costs and fees to Edison in the event that he or she finds that Class Counsel has litigated in a vexatious or frivolous manner in the dispute before the Special Master or Court. Any dispute brought before the Special Master or the Court by Plaintiffs shall be deemed an enforcement action, solely for purposes of this Section, unless the matter is brought to the Special Master or Court jointly with the Company or the dispute concerns whether a claim or claims are Adequately Supported or the final claimants list is correct.

APPLICATIONS FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES,
COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS AND INCENTIVE AWARDS
35. If the Settlement is approved by the District Court, Class Counsel intend to apply to the District Court for an award of attorneys' fees in an amount not to exceed 25% of the $115 million Settlement Fund, plus interest accrued thereon, and for an award of reimbursement for out of pocket costs and disbursements, including expert fees, tax counsel fees, and other expenses. Class Counsel will not seek an award of attorneys' fees for any other portion of the Settlement, including the Salary Increase that Class Counsel estimates to be worth $26 million, and the creation of the Task Force that Class Counsel estimates to be worth $36 million. Accordingly, Class Counsel's application for an award of attorneys' fees will be for approximately 16.3% of the $176.1 million total value of the settlement. Any amounts awarded by the Court for fees and costs will be paid out of the Settlement Fund. As part of the Settlement, the Class representatives and the Settlement Class expressly waive any claim or right to any statutory award of attorneys' fees. The Settlement Fund may be further reduced by the cost of notice and other administrative expenses as approved by the Court. Further, the named plaintiffs in the Action will seek a court award of incentive payments for undertaking representation of the Settlement Class, and assistance provided to Class Counsel in the course of the litigation, in an amount not to exceed $200,000 each for plaintiffs sil Chambers and Bari-Ellen Roberts and not to exceed $100,000 each for plaintiffs Marsha Harris, Veronica Shinault, Janet Williams and Beatrice Hester.

For purposes of this Part, where payment of actual fees and expenses is specified, such fees and expenses are presumptively reasonable. The Agency�s payments are intended to constitute payments toward Class Counsel�s fees, and are not intended to nor shall preclude Class Counsel from additionally retaining a percentage of any Class Member award pursuant to its retainer. Invoices for such fees and expenses shall be itemized, and the amount of attorneys� fees shall equal the number of reasonable hours expended multiplied by a reasonable rate. The parties acknowledge and agree that a significant portion of the work to be performed will be completed by a senior counsel, that is counsel with in excess of eleven years of experience. The Laffey matrix shall serve as evidence of the prevailing market rate. Class Counsel shall serve such invoices both by facsimile and first class mail on Agency Counsel. Except in the case of an objection, the Agency shall render complete payment to Class Counsel within sixty (60) days of receipt of any invoice. Such time limitation shall not be subject to the extension under Part III.A.7, or any other Part of this Agreement, in recognition of the critical function receipt of such fees plays in Class Counsel�s ability to carry out its functions under the Settlement, and in particular the Claims Process.
2. Challenges to Fees
Except with respect to fees and expenses through Final Approval, subpart 3 below, and fees and expenses for Phase III of the Claims Process, subpart 7.c below, within thirty (30) days of receipt of any invoice for fees and expenses, the Agency may in good faith object to a portion of the fees as unreasonable by serving written notice on Class Counsel of such objection and its bases. Thereafter, the parties shall expedite the Enforcement Process under Part VII of this Agreement as follows. They shall first attempt to resolve their dispute informally. In the event such negotiations have not brought resolution within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Agency�s objection, the Class may file a petition for enforcement of the Commission�s decision approving the Settlement Agreement, and/or of the Settlement Agreement itself, including for complete payment of reasonable fees and expenses for seeking such enforcement. Within one week of receipt of a petition to enforce relating to fees, if any, the Agency shall make partial payment of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the fee amount. Any additional amounts shall thereafter be paid in accordance with the ensuing Commission decision.
3. Litigation through Final Approval
Within forty-five (45) days from the Final Approval of this Agreement, the FBI shall make a payment to Class Counsel of actual fees and expenses incurred through Final Approval in full satisfaction of its liability for Class Counsels� fees and expenses incurred through such date.
4. Appeals
Within forty-five (45) days following the Effective Date, Class Counsel shall submit to the Agency for complete payment its reasonable fees and expenses relating to any appeals or objections to the Settlement.
5. Monitoring and Implementation
All invoices for reasonable fees and expenses of Class Counsel, subject to the following caps, relating to monitoring and implementation (but not Enforcement) of the Agreement shall be submitted to the Agency for complete payment every ninety (90) days including for work performed by outside experts and agents. The caps are as follows: during the first year of the Agreement (FY1), fees shall not exceed One Hundred and Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($175,000); during FY2, fees shall not exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), except if the Neutral Expert�s review of the decisions of the Agency review panel is not completed or Class Counsel is required to perform work with respect to the Neutral Expert�s review, then Class Counsel shall be entitled to additional fees at the prorated (by month) amount of $175,000 per year; during FY3 fees shall not exceed Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000); and during FY4 fees shall not exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000). Examples of fees and expenses for monitoring and implementation include, but are not limited to, work performed relating to the Neutral Expert�s Position Review, meetings, consultations with Class Members over concerns of retaliation or noncompliance, and work relating to effectuating the Claims Process (as opposed to review of claim forms and representation of individual Claimants, which is covered pursuant to subpart 7).
6. Enforcement
In the event that the Class is a prevailing party in any enforcement action brought pursuant to Part VII, they shall be entitled to reasonable fees and expenses as provided for under Title VII.
7. The Claims Process
a. Phase I
Every ninety (90) days, Class Counsel shall submit to the Agency for complete payment all reasonable fees and expenses relating to Phase I of the Claims Process.
b. Phase II
Every ninety (90) days, Class Counsel shall submit to the Agency for complete payment all fees and expenses relating to Phase II of the Claims Process, subject to the following limitations. Class Counsel shall be entitled to receive one hundred percent (100%) of their reasonable Phase II fees and expenses relating to any claim that was resolved either through negotiation or mediation. In the event that a claim is not resolved in negotiation or mediation, however, Class Counsel shall be entitled to a payment of sixty-five percent (65%) of their actual Phase II
fees and expenses. Thereafter, if the Claimant prevails or settles in Phase III, Class Counsel shall be retroactively entitled to receive the remaining thirty-five (35%) of their reasonable Phase II attorneys� fees and expenses, plus any Phase III fees and expenses provided for below. Any such payment of residual Phase II fees shall be made within sixty (60) days of the claim�s resolution. A Claimant, if any, who elects representation by alternate counsel shall be entitled to fees subject to the limitations within this section.
c. Phase III
Within sixty (60) days of an arbitrator�s decision under Phase III of the Claims Process where a Claimant is the prevailing party, counsel shall petition the arbitrator for reasonable attorney�s fees and expenses. Counsel shall serve a copy of such petition on Agency Counsel. The Agency may file an objection to such petition within thirty (30) days of its receipt. Within ninety (90) days of the decision on the merits, or within thirty (30) days of receipt of a timely objection, if any, the arbitrator shall issue a decision and order on the petition. The Agency shall comply with such order within sixty (60) days, except that either party may file an appeal of a fee award pursuant to the provisions of the Claims Process.

The parties agree to accept non-material and procedural changes to this Settlement Agreement if so required by the Court in connection with Final Approval of the Settlement, but are not obligated to accept any changes in the monetary amount of relief or the substantive Programmatic Relief provided for herein, or any other substantive change.  (Page, 9)

XI. ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES.
Class Counsel may submit an application (the ""Fee and Expense Application"") for distributions to it from the Settlement Fund for: (a) an award of reasonable attorneys' fees from the Settlement Fund (which shall not exceed one-third of the Settlement Fund net of Court- approved expenses); and (b) payment of expenses incurred in the Action, including but not limited to the fees and expenses of any experts or consultants, incurred in connection with prosecuting or settling the Action, plus any interest earned by the Settlement Fund on such attorneys' fees and expenses at the same rate and for the same periods as earned by the Settlement Fund (until paid). Class Counsel reserves the right to make additional applications for fees and expenses incurred. Defendants shall take no position with respect to Class Counsel's Fee and Expense Application.
The attorneys' fees and expenses, as awarded by the Court, shall be paid to Class Counsel from the Settlement Fund, as ordered, immediately after the later of (1) the Court executes an order awarding such fees and expenses, and (2) the Court enters the Final Approval Order and dismisses the Action with prejudice. Class Counsel shall thereafter allocate the attorneys' fees in a manner in which it in good faith believes reflects the contributions of other counsel for any Named Plaintiff to the prosecution and settlement of the Action. In the event that the Final Approval Order is reversed or modified, or this Settlement Agreement is cancelled or terminated for any other reason, then Class Counsel shall, within five (5) business days from receiving notice from the Bank's Counsel or from a court of appropriate jurisdiction, refund to Defendants the entire amount awarded by the Court and disbursed to Class Counsel for attorneys' fees and expenses (including any amounts that Class Counsel may have distributed to any other counsel for Named Plaintiffs), plus interest (at the rate specified in the preceding paragraph) thereon. In the event that the order making the Fee and Expense Award is reversed or modified, then Class Counsel shall, within five (5) business days from receiving notice from a court of appropriate jurisdiction, refund to the Settlement Fund the amount required by the court's order.
The procedure for and the allowance or disallowance by the Court of any applications for attorneys' fees and expenses, including the fees of experts and consultants, to be paid out of the Settlement Fund, are not part of the settlement set forth in the Settlement Agreement, and are to be considered by the Court separately from the Court's consideration of the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the settlement set forth in the Settlement Agreement, and any order or proceeding relating only to any request for attorneys' fees or expenses, or any appeal from any order relating only thereto or reversal or modification thereof, shall not operate to terminate or cancel the Settlement Agreement, or affect or delay the finality of the Judgment approving the Settlement Agreement and the settlement of the Action set forth herein.
Defendants and Defendants' Counsel shall have no responsibility for or liability whatsoever with respect to any payment to Class Counsel or any other counsel for any Named Plaintiff from the Settlement Fund that may occur. Except for the payment by Defendants of the Settlement Sum, Defendants shall have no responsibility for the payment of attorneys' fees and expenses to any counsel for any Named Plaintiff.

M. Agreement Binding.
As of the date on which counsel for the parties execute this Settlement Agreement, this Settlement Agreement will be binding in all respects, unless it is terminated as set forth in Section XIII, or unless the Court fails to approve this Settlement Agreement and the Settlement Agreement is thus vacated. This Settlement Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the parties hereto and their respective heirs, dependents, executors, administrators, trustees, legal representatives, personal representatives, agents, successors and assigns; provided, however, that this Settlement Agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any third party.
Settlement Class Members will not be deemed third party beneficiaries of the Settlement Agreement and will have no individual right to enforce its terms; rather, only Defendants and the Named Plaintiffs, through Class Counsel, may seek to enforce the terms of the Settlement. Class Counsel and counsel for Defendants shall meet and confer before the commencement of any enforcement proceedings.
(page 59)",3,"B. Duration of the Settlement.
The programmatic relief embodied in this Settlement Agreement and the agreements and other documents incorporated in it shall remain binding on the parties and their agents and successors for a period of three (3) years following the Effective Date. (page 13)

IX. PROGRAMMATIC RELIEF.
A. Duration of the Settlement.
The programmatic relief embodied in this Settlement Agreement and the agreements incorporated herein shall remain binding on the parties and their agents and successors for a three (3)-year period beginning with the later of the Effective Date or February 1, 2014, with all programmatic relief to be implemented and/or initiated, as applicable, during the first year of the (3)-year period. 
(page 30)","IV. ATTORNEYS� FEES, EXPENSES OF CLASS COUNSEL AND
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.
A. Class Counsel Fees and Costs.
Class Counsel shall be entitled to apply to the Court for an award of Plaintiffs� Counsel�s attorneys� fees in a total amount not to exceed 30% of the Settlement Sum, i.e., $11,467,500, plus their litigation expenses. The Parties agree that Class Counsel will hold back $100,000 per year of their awarded fees for each of the three years of the term of the Programmatic Relief for their work in monitoring said Programmatic Relief. The Claims Administrator will maintain this portion of the Court-awarded attorneys� fees in escrow.
Payment of Plaintiffs� attorneys� fees, costs and expenses shall be made exclusively from the Settlement Sum. Defendants� payment of Plaintiffs� attorneys� fees, costs and expenses from the Settlement Sum shall constitute full satisfaction of Defendants� obligation to pay any person, attorney or law firm for attorneys� fees, costs, and expenses incurred on behalf of the Settlement Class and the Named Plaintiffs and shall relieve Defendants from any other claims or liability to any other attorney or law firm or person for any attorneys� fees, expenses and costs to which any of them may claim to be entitled on behalf of the Settlement Class or any of the Named Plaintiffs that are in any way related to the Released Claims or claims released by Named Plaintiffs Julie Moss, Dianne Goedtel, Jean Evans and Mary DeSalvatore in their individual release agreements or in any way related to attorneys� fees, expenses and costs incurred with respect to the prosecution of Judy Calibuso�s individual claims up through and including the Effective Date.
Class Counsel agree to indemnify and hold Defendants harmless from any claims, demands, deficiencies, levies, assessments, executions, judgments or recoveries of any amounts claimed due by any attorney or experts as fees for any work performed for or on behalf of Named Plaintiffs or the Settlement Class Members in this Action, whether a matter of record or not. Class Counsel further agree to hold Defendants harmless from any costs, expenses, or damages, including Defendants� own attorneys� fees sustained by Defendants by reason of any such claim.
B. Defendants� Non-Opposition.
Defendants and their attorneys agree not to oppose any applications for attorneys� fees, costs or expenses by Class Counsel that are fully consistent with Section XII.A.
C. Timing of Attorneys� Fee Payment.
Any attorneys� fees, costs or expenses payable to Class Counsel shall be distributed from the Settlement Sum pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The parties agree that Class Counsel are entitled to receive the Court-ordered attorneys� fees and costs within three (3) business days of the Final Approval, subject to full repayment if the Effective Date is not reached. Defendants shall wire the attorneys� fees payment into an account designated by Class Counsel (information regarding such account will be provided to Defendants at least two weeks prior to the date of the Final Approval Hearing). If the Settlement does not become effective, Plaintiffs� Counsel will repay the money, with the same interest rate as the escrow account in which the Settlement Fund is held. Defendants shall have no liability or other responsibility for the allocation of such attorneys� fees among Plaintiffs� Counsel, which decision shall be made by Class Counsel.
D. Service Awards.
Class Counsel will seek and Defendants will not oppose Court approval for reasonable Service Awards ($35,000.00 each for Judy Calibuso, Julie Moss, Dianne Goedtel, Jean Evans, and Mary DeSalvatore) from the Settlement Sum for their participation in the prosecution and settlement of this case.
This participation included each Plaintiff preparing for and then being deposed for two days each, participating in responding to discovery requests, assisting counsel in developing strategy, and providing input into settlement discussions and the ultimate Settlement Agreement. The proposed Service Awards will be in addition to Settlement Class benefits available to the Named Plaintiffs under the Settlement Agreement and are subject to Court approval. There was no trade-off of classwide relief for the payment of the Service Awards. As noted, all Service Awards shall come from the Settlement Sum, and Named Plaintiffs, except for Judy Calibuso, will be required to execute a full and complete release of any and all claims, known and unknown, against Defendants. (pages, 52-53)

V. TERMINATION OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.
If the Court does not approve any material condition of this Settlement Agreement that effects a fundamental change to the terms of this Settlement hereunder, including but not limited to, the Settlement Sum, the programmatic relief, payments for Plaintiffs� attorneys� fees in excess of thirty percent (30%) plus costs, or the scope of the releases in Section V of this Settlement Agreement, Defendants may treat the entire Settlement Agreement as void and unenforceable.
The application for attorneys� fees, costs and expenses, as set forth in Section XII, is a matter separate and apart from the Settlement Agreement among the parties, and no decision by the Court concerning the granting, in whole or in part, of such attorneys� fees, costs or expenses as set forth herein shall affect the validity of this Settlement Agreement or finality of the Settlement Agreement in any manner.

A. Fairfield will not oppose Settlement Class Counsel�s application to the Court for an allocation of 28% (and no greater percentage) of all amounts identified for payment under Section IV(A), above, to attorneys� fees incurred on behalf of the Settlement Class, under a �common fund� theory. The common fund would include the following:
1. The Type 1 Allocations under Section IV(A)(l)(b) for both Category A and B, which amount in total to $1,232,500;
2. An assumption that there will be ten Settlement Class Members who file a Type I Claim and receive the $5,000 augmentation described in Section IV(A)(l)(b)(v), above, which amounts in total to an additional $50,000;
3. An assumed doubling of one-quarter (Vi) of the total Type 1 Allocations pursuant to Section IV(A)(l)(c), above, which amounts in total to an additional $308,125;
4. The $3,000,000 maximum total of Type 2 payments pursuant to Section I, Paragraph 9, before any �flow in� from the Type 1 allocations; and
5. The recoveries for the five Plaintiffs, which total $550,000. Thus, by way of example, the gross Type 1payment to a Category A Settlement Class Member with less than 91 days employment with Fairfield during the Settlement Class Period, under Section IV(A)(l)(b)(iii), above, is $2,000; pursuant to this common fund allocation of attorneys� fees, $560 of this amount would roll into the fee allocation (assuming that the common fund request of 28% is approved by the Court), and the remaining $1,440 would be allocated to the Settlement Class Member. Similarly, by way of example, 28% of the recovery for each of the Plaintiffs will roll into the fee allocation (assuming that the common fund request of 28% is approved by the Court), and the remaining 72% would be allocated to the Plaintiff. In addition, Fairfield Resorts agrees to reimburse Settlement Class Counsel for reasonable expenses incurred on behalf of the Settlement Class, in an amount to be approved by the Court, but not to exceed $50,000. The parties agree that, if the Court approves the 28% common fund fee application, then the correct amount of attorneys� fees identified pursuant to this Paragraph is $1,439,235; subject only to the Court�s approval, the parties agree that this amount will be a sum certain, and shall not be further conditioned upon the accuracy of the assumptions in Sections IX(A)(2) and (3), above, or upon how much ultimately is paid out to Settlement Class Members in Type I or Type II claims.
B. Any fees and expenses payable to Settlement Class Counsel shall be within the solediscretionoftheCourt. The validity of the Consent Decree is not contingent on any ruling regarding the payment o f attorneys� fees and expenses.
C. The amounts described in this Section, payment o f which is subject to the Court�s approval, shall be the sum total o f the amounts to be paid by Fairfield in attorneys� fees and/or expenses with regard to this Case. This maximum recovery applies no matter how many Type I or Type II claims are filed, and no matter how much Settlement Class Counsel incurs in time and expenses with respect to the Decree approval process, the claims process, or any other process related to this Decree.
D. Fairfield Resorts will issue payment to Settlement Class Counsel for such attorneys� fees and expenses as are approved by the Court within ten (10) days after the Court has issued its Order on Settlement Class Counsel�s fee application; provided, however, that no such payment will be made until after the Effective Date.
